                    This is a web-based version of the classic game Connect 4. I made this project while learning how to program in 7th grade. It only has local multiplayer, and I don't plan on improving it any further. I'm just keeping it here for nostalgia.

                    This was a website I built in 8th grade as the multi-genre portfolio for my research project on AI. My idea for this website was to have a fictional persona present my findings in the form of fictional articles, interviews, and blog posts, rather than just glue pieces of paper to a poster board, which was what everyone else was doing. Note that this was created in 2018, before ChatGPT and the general boom of AI in 2023, so many of these ideas are no longer current. This was one of the first full websites that I built.

                    This project was a website I created in 8th grade to explain the basics of Newton's Laws of Motion for my science class. The website includes interactive elements and animations to help illustrate the concepts of inertia, acceleration, and action-reaction. It was a fun and educational project that helped me understand the principles of physics while also improving my web development skills.

                    This project contains three different versions of the classic game Rock Paper Scissors. The first version is a basic implementation using JavaScript alerts. The second version uses jQuery to add interactivity. The third version is an extended version of the game that includes Lizard and Spock, inspired by the TV show "The Big Bang Theory". All versions are played against an AI that chooses its moves randomly.
